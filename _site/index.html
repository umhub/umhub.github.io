<p class="description" data-aos="fade-down">UMHUB will be used to guide students to choose the correct program and courses under their degree path. It will show an outline of the course order the students should enroll in and provide an overview of different subjects and their professors.  Users can choose to sign-in to the system to access other actions, including rating courses and professors. This system intends to act as a tool to motivate students to prepare ahead for classes by using relevant discussion groups and a place to exchange or sell textbooks.</p>

      <section class="card neumorphism-card-big">
        <h1 class="title">Intended Users</h1>
<p class="description" data-aos="fade-down">The system is mainly targeted towards students currently studying at the University of Manitoba, though it can also be of use to prospective students, recent graduates, academic advisors, and tutors. Students can easily see all the different courses, including any course prerequisites they can take in a program and an overview of the content taught in those courses all in one place. Moreover, students will have the chance to discuss and get help from peers who agree to provide tutoring. Prospective students can also use this system to educate themselves on the various courses available at the university, helping them plan for their future semesters. Apart from students, academic advisors can use this system to explain to students about different degree paths they can take and guide them conveniently. Tutors can use the system to see the assigned tutor ratings and conclude if they need improvements in their teaching methods.</p>

        <h1 class="title">Overview of major functionality</h1>
<p class="description" data-aos="fade-down">First, the system will give the option to log in or continue as a guest account. The guest users will have limited functionalities compared to the registered users. When inside, it will provide a list of majors that are currently available at the University of Manitoba. Choosing one such major will list all the different program options available for students to select. The user can either view all the courses under one major or view courses specific to one chosen program. Furthermore, each subject will have multiple features specific to it. These include a course description (overview of the course content and any prerequisites), a list of current reviews for the course, a function to add a new review and also, see and rate the tutors available.</p>

        <h1 class="title">Sales Pitch</h1>
<p class="description" data-aos="fade-down">The system will be a significant improvement to the already existing designs. It will provide answers to all the frequently asked questions, particularly by the students. The long queues in front of the student advisors' offices and delayed responses can get frustrating. Therefore, the system aims to provide the students with all the necessary course information quickly and easily without any appointments. The system will provide adequate information for students to choose the right course at the right time. This will help reduce the number of withdrawals or excess courses, speeding up their degree completion. Besides, the system provides a platform to buy and sell used textbooks and avoid buying expensive new ones or struggle to find used books. Past students can provide details of their experiences working with different courses and tutors. The general discussion and social groups will help develop peer bonds, especially amongst the new undergraduate students. Additionally, the system intends to easy to use and reliable by all users equally.</p>

<p class="description" data-aos="fade-down">Why?</p>
<ul class="description" data-aos="fade-down">
    <li><b>Iteration 0 - </b> Just documentation. We were able to get everything done as estimated.</li>
    <br>
    <li><b>Iteration 1 - </b> Huge learning curve and needed extra time to research on how to do different implementations.</li>
    <br>
    <li><b>Iteration 2 - </b> HSQLDB database crashed and had to invest more time fixing it.</li>
    <br>
    <li><b>Iteration 3 - </b> We were able to get the features done fast. We spent the extra time switching HSQLDB to SQLite.</li>

        <h1 class="title">Postmortem</h1>
<ul class="description" data-aos="fade-down">
    <li>
        <b>What went right in the development process?</b>
        <br>
        We maintained daily communication and hosted weekly meetings to keep members updated. Each team member branched off from develop and worked on different features and user stories to get more work done in less time. If one person faced an error or problem that they could not solve, everyone discussed it during the meeting and tried to solve it. We put manageable deadlines inside the iteration after each team meeting for the expected work to be done.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        <b>What went wrong in the development process?</b>
        <br>
        The main thing we deeply struggled with was the database implementation. We initially implemented the database using HSQLDB. Unfortunately, we got outstanding errors that we failed to resolve. For iteration 3, we switched to an SQLite database.  Another thing we struggled with was conflicts between different team member's codes. Sometimes changes were made by multiple members to the same code/class, and once merged, we had many clashes to be resolved and had to ensure the code works as expected.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        <b>What took the most time? The least? Any surprises?</b>
        <br>
        Initially, designing a new layout for a feature took more time since we had to research a lot. Eventually, it got easier as we created different types of activity layouts. We were also able to spend the extra time to make the application more appealing and enhance the user experience. During the last two iterations, connecting the database to work with our code took most of our time.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        <b>How did the project change from your initial (iteration 0) vision or stories, or did it work out as predicted?</b>
        <br>
        We had to push back some features and user stories to the next iteration as we ran out of time to implement them. Our estimates in iteration 0 were too high. By the end of iteration 3, we got most of the high-priority features done but had to push the remaining unimplemented features and user stories to the 'Future' milestone. We changed some implementation and design ideas we initially planned to compensate with time and what was available on Android Studio. For example, we could not implement the courses as a flowchart illustration instead, we separated the courses into tables.
